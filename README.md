# File-Manager
I work a lot and save many different sessions to trace back my work, I am also music lover and I love to capture memories when I explore etc. But all these photos, music, data etc stack up together making it difficult for me to pick right file at time. So, I have got an idea to create a File Manager to trace my own work and gives me suggestions based on my data usage.
